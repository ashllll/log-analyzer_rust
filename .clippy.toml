# Clippy Configuration for Log Analyzer
# Purpose: Enforce code quality and prevent common mistakes

# Error Handling Rules
# Prevent panic-inducing methods in production code
# unwrap() and expect() should only be used in tests or with clear justification
unwrap-used = "warn"
expect-used = "warn"

# Require explicit error handling
# This encourages using ? operator or proper error matching
missing-errors-doc = "warn"

# Performance Rules
inefficient-to-string = "warn"
large-enum-variant = "warn"
large-stack-arrays = "warn"

# Correctness Rules
correctness = { level = "deny" }

# Code Quality
nursery = { level = "warn" }
pedantic = { level = "warn" }

# Allow some pedantic lints that are too strict
allow = [
    "module-name-repetitions",
    "similar-names", 
    "too-many-lines",
